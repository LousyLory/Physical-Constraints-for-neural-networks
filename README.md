This project explores the effect of physicality constraints on neural networks. This is a part of my synthesis project.

Essentially each neuron is given a physical co-ordinate and trained by adding this to the loss function. For more insights please visit: https://github.com/LousyLory/Physical_Constraints_NN/wiki

To start training please run `python main.py`
